        <p>Hi, 
          Currently, I am a computer science student and in my 5th semester at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology, Denmark (KÃ¸benhavns Erhversakademi - KEA). Coming from a science background as a Microbiologist, I like to query how and why? Hence, I like embarking on writing codes that would give value to the end user. 
          I am currently looking for opportunities to explore and apply the knowledge I have gained in school and use such in the corporate world in solving problems. 
          I love collaborating with others to proffer the best solutions and open to earning new technologies that will enhance my skills. See some of my works in 'My Works'
